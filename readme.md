# nbt2json

A command line utility and module that reads NBT data and converts it to JSON or YAML for editing and then back to NBT.

This is a fork of [Jim Nelson's nbt2json code](https://github.com/midnightfreddie/nbt2json).
It improves parsing accuracy for large integer values such as the world seed.

Most credit should go to Jim Nelson who wrote the vast majority of this code.

## Features

- Command line utility will auto-detect and decompress gzipped files
- Can read both MCPE/Win10 and Java-based NBT data
    - Does not auto-detect which
    - Utility defaults to MCPE / little endian
- `--skip` parameter allows skipping headers. e.g. `nbt2json --skip 8 /path/to/level.dat` for MCPE's level.dat
- `--yaml` parameter converts to/from YAML instead of JSON
- `--comment "My comment here"` parameter allows adding a comment field to the JSON/YAML output
- `nbt2json -h` for usage info

## Why?

\<sigh\> Out of all the NBT tools out there, none of them seem to do what I want:

- Read MCPE (phones, tablets and Win10 app store edition) NBT data which use little endian encoding where the PC Java version uses big endian
- Convert back and forth to a human readable REST-API-able format
- Be includeable or as portable as my Go code

There are some Go options I could adapt for little endian, but I'll have to do enough work to make it convert to JSON and back that it's probably simpler to start from scratch, and I'm pretty sure I know how I want to do it.

## Dev notes

- The Json2Nbt function uses an `interface{}` and encodes based on the tagType fields. I had originally hoped to Marshal and Unmarshal to and from JSON and NBT, but my goal was to export to JSON, edit and then reencode. This way the struct doesn't have to match the data schema.
- My main motivation for this project is to convert to/from JSON and use any JSON editor to modify Minecraft PE data with [McpeTool](https://github.com/midnightfreddie/McpeTool), and to keep the read/write primitives in Go code while letting a client browser manage any validation to avoid having to re-release the read/write tools every time Minecraft changes formats.
